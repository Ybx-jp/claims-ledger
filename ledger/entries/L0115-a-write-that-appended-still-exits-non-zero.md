## Assertion

A run that appended verdicts exits non-zero, so the appended text is looked at before it is committed.

## Scope

metric: the exit status of a writing run whose findings were all flags
cohort: runs invoked with --write
condition: a moved ground is reported as a flag, which alone would exit zero

## Grounds

- code: src/claims_ledger/freshness.py § "run" @c1f9f2b89bb28557c7d0b6be9f5d29909677a848

## Warrant

run appends a failure for each entry it wrote to, naming how many verdicts it added. The sibling checker gets this for free, because every block it queues sits beside a failure; here the moved case sits beside a flag, so without this the ledger was modified by machinery and the run exited zero. The specification requires the non-zero exit for exactly that reason: a file in the ledger has just been changed by something other than a person.

## Backing

none

  note: read against commit 2a76453, which moved the citing comment for this claim into the section its ground names, or out of a section it did not; the code in this section is byte-identical at the pin and at that commit once comments and docstrings are set aside, so nothing the claim rests on changed

  note: read against commit 54aa2e4, which passes the run's ancestry memo to effective_pointer and orphans; nothing else in the loop changed, and the appends, the failure without a repository, the exit after a write, the unstatable artifact, the terminal exemption and the once-per-run memo hold; the assertion holds as written.

  note: read against the working tree after freshness began comparing by digest on both sides: a write that appended still reports a failure per entry written; the assertion holds as written.
